	  This allows you to regulate in-kernel activities in a profile-oriented manner.
	  It creates a sysfs node which can be used to change profiles via userspace.
	  It provides 4 profile modes: Disabled, Battery, Balanced and Performance.

	  The former can be used to disable/enable or tune kernel activities according
	  to a profile mode. Check the README.md for more information.

	  It's safe to say Y here, as the driver isn't very demanding and is only
	  used when developer uses the exported API functions in an another driver.
